		<p>In this implementation we show how to create a singleton object. This does nothing
			other than show hwo the objects construction is managed through the instance
			method. It is important to note that in this implementation that the
			construction of the object is protected by a set of synchronisation guards
			and also the use of volatile to protect the instance variable.</p>
		
		<p>Note in Java versions prior to Java 5, the volatile keyword will not work and as such
			lazy instantiation is not recommended.</p>
