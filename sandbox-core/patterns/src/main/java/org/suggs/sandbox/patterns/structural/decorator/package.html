		<p>This package contains two subpackages:
			<ul>
				<li>Beverage - contains implementations of the IBeverage interface.
					These are the classes that are to be decorated.</li>
				<li>BeverageDecorator - contains the decorator classes that implement
					the IBeverage interface and thus wrap the underlying beverage
					classes.</li>
			</ul>
			</p>
		
		<p>The key thing to note here is that there are two type of class here, the kernel
			classes that can be dcorated and the decorator objects that 'wrap' up the kernel
			classes and thus extend their behaviour.</p>
