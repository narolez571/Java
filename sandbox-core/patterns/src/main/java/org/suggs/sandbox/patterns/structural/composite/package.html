		<p>In this package we implement the composite pattern using the menus from a
			collection of restaurants. This implementation shows that we have hide the fact
			that there are many differnt menus through the use of a common menu tree. This
			implementation contains MenuComponents and MenuItems. MenuComponents
			adhere to the same interface as MenuItems but they are containers for MenuItems.
			As they shae the same interface we can call doewn thr tree recursively to get the
			full collection of menu items in the tree. So for example we can call print at
			anywhere in the tree and get the full rest of the tree recursivelt called.</p>
