		<p>In this pacakge we have an implementation of the adapater pattern. We have two
			birds that have two different interfaces. However if we want one of the birds to
			have the same behaviour as the other (and when I say behaviour I mean interface) we
			havw to use an adapter to make the other bird behave in the same way.</p>
		
		<p>The key thing to note here is that to make one object change its defined interface to
			that of another, you need to create an adapter that will translate the
			objects behaviour to the behaviour of the other object.</p>
