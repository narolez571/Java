		<p>This package contains a simple implementation of the state pattern. In this implementation 
			we have a calendar editor that allows us to  </p>
		
		<p>The key thing to note here is that each state confirms to a certain API ie the defined
			behaviour of the gumball machine. Given that each performed action on the
			gumball machine can happen when it is in a differnt state the behaviour of the
			machine must differ depending on its state. So for examope if there are no coins in
			the machine it is not correct for it to eject a coin. This is state dependent and
			thus we can say that the use of this pattern allows for differing behaviour within
			a class.</p>
