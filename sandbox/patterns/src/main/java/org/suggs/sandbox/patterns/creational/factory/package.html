		<p>This implementation of the factory pattern is used for the construction of
			Pizzas. The underlying factory implementation is wrapped up in the createPizza
			method and shows how the the implementation of the object construction is moved
			away from the rest of the pizza process.</p>
		
		<p>The main thing to note here is that if the pizza construction process changes from
			the types of pizza that are constructed, the classes ar separated so that a change
			to one does not affect the other.</p>
