		<p>In this package we demonstrate the observer pattern using a single subject (a
			weather station) and then set up a number of observers on this subject. I have
			deliberately stayed away from the Java Observer interface and Observable
			abstract class so that we can implement the raw underlying pattern.</p>
		
		<p>The key thing to note in this pattern is that the observaber can be updated with
			change information and the observerable has the ability to have observers
			regsiter with it so that they can be updated.</p>
