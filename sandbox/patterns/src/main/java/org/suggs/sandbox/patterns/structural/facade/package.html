		<p>In this package we have a subpackage containing the uber-complicated home
			theatre system and a single Facade class that simplifies the access to the
			subsystem by introducing an additional, more simple interface.</p>
		
		<p>The key thing to note that although a new interface is provided that wraps up the
			existing interface, the existing interface is also available.</p>
