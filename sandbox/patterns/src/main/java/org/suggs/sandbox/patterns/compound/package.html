		<p>This package contains not just single implementations of patterns but compound
			patterns ie petterns that also use patterns to provide an overall solution.
			<ol>
				<li>
					<p>DuckFest - this uses the following patterns
						<ol>
							<li>Adapter - to manage the goose object as an
								IQuackable</li>
							<li>Decorator - to introduce some level of quack counting
								functionality (piss poor approach but hey .. see the
								static variable that is counted)</li>
							<li>Factory - to create the ducks (uses an abstract
								factory)</li>
							<li>Composite - creates a collection of objects that adheres
								to the same interface as the composite objects.</li>
							<li>Observer - for the quackologist</li>
						</ol></p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>Model View Controller - this uses the following patterns:
						<ol>
							<li>Stratgy - </li>
