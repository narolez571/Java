		<p>This package contains not just single implementations of patterns but compound
			patterns ie petterns that also use patterns to provide an overall solution.
			<ul>
				<li>DuckFest - this uses the following patterns
					<ul>
						<li>Adapter - to manage the goose object as an IQuackable</li>
						<li>Decorator - to introduce some level of quack counting
							functionality (piss poor approach but hey .. see the
							static variable that is counted)</li>
						<li>Factory - to create the ducks (uses an abstract factory)</li>
						<li>Composite - creates a collection of objects that adheres to
							the same interface as the composite objects.</li>
						<li>Observer - </li>
					</ul></li>
			</ul></p>
