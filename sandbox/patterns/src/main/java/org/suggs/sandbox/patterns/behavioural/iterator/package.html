		<p>In this package we have an implementation of the iterator pattern using a menu
			system from two restaurants. The aggregates package contains the underlying
			collections and the iterators package conatains the differing implentations
			of the iteration algorithm. Please note that other than at the object
			construction the Waitress has no knowledge of the differing iterator
			implementations and thus also has no knowledge of the differing structures of
			the menu collections.</p>
		
		<p>The key thing to note from this pattern is that the iteration through the menu items
			is encapsulated away from the underlying menu and the API of the iteration is
			defined through an interface. Thus for any collection of objects a common
			algorithm can be used to move through the collection of objects.</p>
