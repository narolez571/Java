		<p>In this implementation we have the concept of a person (interface and class) and
			also some invocation handlers. These two handlers are used to define the correct
			behaviour that is allowed on the person object depending on the caller of the
			functionality.</p>
		
		<p>In this package we dynamically construct proxies based on invocation handlers.
			In this way we are using the reflection functionality in the Java API to
			manage the validity of the object intersctions.</p>
