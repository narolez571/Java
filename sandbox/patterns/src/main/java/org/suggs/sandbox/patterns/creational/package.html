<body bgcolor="white"> This top level package contains example code for the creational
	patterns, ie those patterns that are used to instantiate other objects (or themselves).
	This package contains the following specific patterns.
	<ul>
		<li>Factory pattern - This implementation uses a Pizza Store as an example for the
			factory pattern. There is an abstract Pizza Store object that delegates the
			creation of Pizzas to the concrete Pizza Stores. It is in these stores that that
			factory methods are implemented. They will each take a string as a type to build
			and based on that type will build the correct type of Pizza. It is then up to
			the factory method to construct the correct Pizza type.</li>
		<li>Abstract Factory pattern</li>
		<li>Builder pattern</li>
		<li>Singleton pattern</li>
		<li>Prototype pattern</li>
	</ul>
