		<p>This package contains two implementations of the same class structure that shows
			how the template pattern realy works.
			<ul>
				<li>Untemplatised where methods in the base class are calld by concrete
					implementations of the interface in the concrete classes, in effect
					calling up the class hierarchy</li>
				<li>Templatised where the interface methods are implemented at the base
					classes and then abstract methods are created to fullfil the class
					hierarchy differences.</li>
			</ul> One of the main benefits of this pattern is seen when you consider an
			implementation where we want to expose the high level interface but wish to
			completeoy hide away the underlying implementation using package level scope
			for the class visability.</p>
