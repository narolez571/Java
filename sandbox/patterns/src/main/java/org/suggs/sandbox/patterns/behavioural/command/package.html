	<p>This package contains an implementation of the Command pttern in the form of a remote
		control. We have many different receivers that can be controlled by the remote
		control but each of them has a different behavioural interface. We also have a few
		select invokers which ar ethe remote controls. We also have a collection of commands
		that form the collection of behaviors of the receivers, whcih all implement the
		ICommand interface.</p>
	
	<p>We can see in this implementation how the command pattern works by encapsulating the
		method invocations and allowing these encapsulated method calls to be
		interfaces in a generic way.</p>
