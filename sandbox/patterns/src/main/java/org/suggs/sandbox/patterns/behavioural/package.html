        <p>This top level package contains example code for the behavioural patterns, ie
            those patterns that are concerned with the communications between objects.
            This package contains the following specific patterns.
            <ul>
                <li>Chain of Responsibility pattern - </li>
                <li>Command pattern - encasulates a request in an object with a simple
                    execute method. Each command that can be executed by an invoker is
                    encapsulated into an object. Each command has an object that it can
                    execute a command on. Thus the command objects provide a simple and
                    standard interface to a varying interface on the recipient object
                    (receiver). There are three main parties in the pattern: Client
                    (initiates the request by creating the command); Invoker (who manages
                    the invokation of the command); and Receiver (who the command is
                    executed on). The command object will be the one that has compile time
                    bindings against the Receiver object.</li>
                <li>Interpretor pattern - </li>
                <li>Iterator pattern - this pattern concerns itself with moving through a
                    list of objects in a collection (aggregates). If the aggregates have
                    different interfaces then the algorithm for traversing the aggregate
                    will be different. Here we encapsulate the traversal of the aggregate
                    into an object with a single interface. The implementation of the
                    interator is a drivation of an 'Interator' interface for each type of
                    concrete aggregate, with the concrete iterator having a composite
                    relationship to the collection.</li>
                <li>Mediator pattern - </li>
                <li>Memento pattern - </li>
                <li>Observer pattern - this pattern defines communications in a
                    one-to-many object relationship. When the state of the subject object
                    changes, the change must be communicated to the depemndent objects.
                    Please note that this impl does not use the built in Observer
                    class/interface in the language.</li>
                <li>State pattern - this pattern allows the internal behaviour of a class to
                    alter depending on the state of the class. The object's state is
                    encapsulated into a collection of state objects that define the way
                    that actions/events will work on a class and thus its behaviour to those
                    actions/events. Thus it can be said that the implementation of the
                    state patterns allows for an object to appear to change its class. This
                    differs from the strategy pattern in that the client does not know about
                    the state and indeed the state changes.</li>
                <li>Strategy pattern - </li>
                <li>Template pattern - this pattern is concerned with a templatised
                    algorithm implementation within a base class in preference to an
                    implementation within a concrete classes calling back up the
                    hierarchy for common methods. To implement this method you really need
                    to look at an algorithm used by subclasses and work out what the common
                    pieces of functionality are (functionaldecomposition) and create
                    called abstract methods for the non common ones. The addition of
                    implemented hooks (ie methods that can be overridden by subclasses)
                    allows for further design extension.</li>
                <li>Visitor pattern - </li>
            </ul></p>
