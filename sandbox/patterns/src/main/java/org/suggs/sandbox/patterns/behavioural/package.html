<body bgcolor="white"> This top level package contains example code for the behavioural
	patterns, ie those patterns that are concerned with the communications between objects.
	This package contains the following specific patterns.
	<ul>
		<li>Chain of Responsibility pattern - </li>
		<li>Command pattern - encasulates a request in an object with a simple execute
			method. Each command that can be executed by an invoker is encapsulated into an
			object. Each command has an object that it can execute a command on. Thus the
			command objects provide a simple and standard interface to a varying interface
			on the recipient object (receiver). There are three main parties in the pattern:
			Client (initiates the request by creating the command); Invoker (who manages
			the invokation of the command); and Receiver (who the command is executed on).
			The command object will be the one that has compile time bindings against
			the Receiver object.</li>
		<li>Interpretor pattern - </li>
		<li>Iterator pattern - </li>
		<li>Mediator pattern - </li>
		<li>Memento pattern - </li>
		<li>Observer pattern - this pattern defines communications in a one-to-many object
			relationship. When the state of the subject object changes, the change must be
			communicated to the depemndent objects. Please note that this impl does
			not use the built in Observer class/interface in the language.</li>
		<li>State pattern - </li>
		<li>Strategy pattern - </li>
		<li>Template pattern - this pattern is concerned with a templatised algorithm
			implementation within a base class in preference to an implementation within a
			concrete classes calling back up the hierarchy for common methods. To implement
			this method you really need to look at an algorithm used by subclasses and work out
			what the common pieces of functionality are (functionaldecomposition) and
			create called abstract methods for the non common ones. The addition of
			implemented hooks (ie methods that can be overridden by subclasses)
			allows for further design extension.</li>
		<li>Visitor pattern - </li>
	</ul>
