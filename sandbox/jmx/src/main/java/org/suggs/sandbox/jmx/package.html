        This package contains the following:
        <ul>
            <li>helloworld - this package contains a really simple MBean interface to show
                how easily an MBean can be deployed to an MBean server. It uses the
                HttpAdapter to gain access to the Mbean server.</li>
            <li>jmxbook - this package breaks down the JMX agent to have two access points:
                the HttpAdapter as used before; and the RMI Connector server. This is then
                access via an MBean server connection to manage the deployed MBeans. This
                implementation also deploys an MBean to the servr through the RMI
                Connector. This package also contains a collection of MBean components
                that can be deployed to the MBean server with the client:
                <ul>
                    <li>propertymanager - Standard MBean that allows access to a
                        properties file</li>
                    <li>dbmanager - Stanadrd MBean that allows access to a
                        datasource through JNDI</li>
                    <li>logmanager - Standard MBean that allows access to a log manager
                        class (this utilises an MBen to Mbean lookup)</li>
                    <li>polling - Standard MBean that uses notifications. This is a
                        simple start/stop thread application</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
