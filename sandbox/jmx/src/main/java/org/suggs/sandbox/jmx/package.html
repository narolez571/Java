        This package contains the following:
        <ul>
            <li>helloworld - this package contains a really simple MBean interface to show
                how easily an MBean can be deployed to an MBean server. It uses the
                HttpAdapter to gain access to the Mbean server.</li>
            <li>jmxbook - this package breaks down the JMX agent to have two access points:
                the HttpAdapter as used before; and the RMI Connector server. This is then
                access via an MBean server connection to manage the deployed MBeans. This
                implementation also deploys an MBean to the servr through the RMI
                Connector.</li>
            <li>configmanager - this package provides mplementation examples that show
                how you can use JMX to dynamically control and configure an application
                through its deployed MBeans. Not all of these have been deployed but they do
                provide a good level of examples from which to refer to.</li>
        </ul>
